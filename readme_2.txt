bobFileApp
- This program is intended to backup and maintain personal data file such as pictures, documents, and videos
	where there is no reason to have duplicated files or reuse file names in different directories.

- Before backup sync operation, remove all duplicated files in both source and destination 

- Checksum validation does not function properly if there are duplicated files

- Remove duplicates, use compare checksum option to validate because sometimes shutil.filecmp doesn't 
	work when two files have the same size and modification dates
	usually these files are generated by other programs, rather than archive of personal files
	so should be moved out of personal data directory

- Finding duplicated files only remove files with duplicated content
	files with reused file names require user to investigate and manually remove or rename
